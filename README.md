# Basic-Visualisation-using-python
I executed some basic visualisation and descriptive statistical commands on a dataset.
The dataset has four columns out of which two coulmns are of categorical data.
# The project states :
An Australian manufacturing company is keen to develop new products and develop new
product line of jackets so that the company can expand into Asian markets more than before.
The data have been collected for 99 products from the market. The file includes:
- PRICE: Price of the jackets in dollars.
- GENDER: 1 for Female product and 2 for Male product.
- COUNTRY: the country in which the jackets is produced: 1 made in China, 2 made in Singapore and 3 made in Thailand.
- COST: Production cost of the jackets in dollars
